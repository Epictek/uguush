poomf.sh
========

puush-like functionality for pomf.se

usage: -f for fullscreen capture, -s for a selection rectangle, and -u (file) to upload a file.
for best results, bind each operation to a hotkey using sxhkd or xbindkeys.

requires scrot, curl, xclip (for auto-copy), and libnotify (for notifications)
